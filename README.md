## IdleRPG

#### What is IdleRPG?

IdleRPG is a simple idle game in the vein of Progress Quest, focused on combat and character progress. There will be little-to-no player agency. Game is meant to work in the background, and player can only set the priorities.

#### What it is not?

It is not a clicker game. The progress can not be speed up by player activity.

#### What is current development status of IdleRPG?

Game is in the early stage of development. There is a lot of missing content. Most of the basic mechanics is already implemented, though.

Roadmap:

- [x] simple town, when player can heal wounds
- [ ] more interesting town, with shops and other activities
- [x] simple dungeon generation (currently it is just a set of rooms with enemies)
- [ ] more complex dungeon, with traps, treasure chests, etc.
- [x] basic combat system (taking into account actors stats)
- [ ] special attacks and resistances
- [ ] looting and equipping items
- [ ] ...more...

#### How is this game being developed?

IdleRPG is made with PICO-8. It is my first take on fantasy consoles.

Project is public, released under FreeBSD license.
